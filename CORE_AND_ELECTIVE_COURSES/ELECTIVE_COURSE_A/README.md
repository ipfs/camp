## What you will learn with this Course

You will learn about the state of decentralized identity on the DWeb and current efforts on creating open and interoperable models to solve self-sovereign identities. More specifically, we will introduce you to Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), Verifiable Credentials and DID-Auth. These standards are gaining traction and are being widely adopted by various projects, organizations and companies.

You will also learn about solutions that you may use today to provide authentication to DApps, including their shortcomings and disadvantages.

Finally, you will get to know IDM (Identity Manager), an open Identity Wallet specification, and Nomios, a reference identity wallet of that specification. Besides explaining and showcasing Nomios, we will be integrating it in a DApp to demonstrate how you can easily have authentication and signing in your DApps.
