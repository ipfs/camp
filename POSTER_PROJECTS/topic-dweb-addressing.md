# DWeb Addressing

Systems like IPFS use hashes of data to reference content by itself, rather than by an arbitrary location/name.  
Traditional identifiers are required in order to work with legacy URI systems like web browsers.  
This poster should detail the work that relates to creating a bridge between these protocols. Such as the [ipfs-companion](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-companion) browser extension.

## Goal

Use whatever resources available to you, in order to come up with a visual representation of the topic that can be projected on to a poster (similar in spirit to the [poster description](README.md#description) but with whatever creative freedom your group prefers :^)

## Questions to Answer

- What is the current state of dweb protocol and address handling in web browsers?
- What is needed for other vendors to implement support?
- How have IPFS nodes handled migrating to browser compatible addresses?
- What challenges have there been in handling compatibility?
