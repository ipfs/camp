# Connection prioritisation

How can we prioritise connections so that important connections are not dropped and important dials happen more quickly. `ipfs swarm friend add <addr> - stay connected as long as possible, don't kill connections, reconnect on failure`. _Right now_ we add the cluster nodes to the gateway nodes (`swarm connect`) every minute.

## Goal

<Define what we would get if the Open Problem(s) are solved for this Deep Dive>

## Requirements to consider

<Do we have requirements (i.e. work with 1MM nodes)?>

## Where to learn about it

<List of talks, links to github issues, code, notes and so on>
