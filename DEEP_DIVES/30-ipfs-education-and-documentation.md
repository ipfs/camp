# IPFS Docs

IPFS is kicking off a documentation revamp in Q3, with a team dedicated specifically to making it easier to contribute IPFS docs and maintain them. In this session, we will explore the state of our current documentation, and where the most valuable improvements could be made.

## Goal

By the end of this session, we hope to pool our knowledge about the current state of IPFS documentation; the best descriptions and/or analogies of the DWeb and IPFS we've seen in the wild; favorite/least-favorite documentation approaches elsewhere; and priorities to tackle first. If there's time, we may hack on docs improvements together! #justdoit

## Where to learn about it
