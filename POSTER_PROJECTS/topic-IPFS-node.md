# An IPFS Node

In order to construct a network of nodes, we need nodes themselves. Nodes may be implemented in any language, so long as they follow a set of specifications. Once implemented, they may interact with other nodes on a network. 

## Goal

Use whatever resources available to you, in order to come up with a visual representation of the topic that can be projected on to a poster (similar in spirit to the [poster description](README.md#description) but with whatever creative freedom your group prefers :^)

## Questions to Answer

- What are the reference implementations of an IPFS node?
- What other implementations exist (whole or components)?
- Can you have your own separate network of nodes?
