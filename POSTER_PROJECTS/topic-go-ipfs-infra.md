# Go-IPFS Infrastructure

This poster should cover what it takes to initialize a go-IPFS node, and connect it to a public P2P network.

## Goal

Use whatever resources available to you, in order to come up with a visual representation of the topic that can be projected on to a poster (similar in spirit to the [poster description](README.md#description) but with whatever creative freedom your group prefers :^)

## Questions to Answer

- How does the IPFS node initialize itself?
  - What services does it offer?
- What configuration options do you have for a node?
  - daemon profiles, node config 
- How is the network initialized?
  - What technologies are used (libp2p, DHT, TCP, etc.)
