# IPFS on Mobile

Increasingly, everyday computing is happening in mobile environments. At the same time, many features of IPFS and related technologies work best on an 'always-connected' network that simply doesn't exist in the mobile world. In this deep dive, we will explore the issues inherent to p2p systems operating in mobile environments, discuss some existing solutions, and hopefully outline a research/development agenda that will help catalyze a wave of new IPFS-based mobile solutions.

## Goal

<Define what we would get if the Open Problem(s) are solved for this Deep Dive>

## Requirements to consider

<Do we have requirements (i.e. work with 1MM nodes)?>

## Where to learn about it

<List of talks, links to github issues, code, notes and so on>
