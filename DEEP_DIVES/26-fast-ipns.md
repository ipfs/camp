# Fast IPNS

How to increase the IPNS resolution speed

## Goal

- We should be able to come up with new ways to publish/resolve IPNS records or improve the existing ones.
- We should be able to describe strategies to handle multiple ways to publish and resolve.

## Requirements to consider

- We need to achieve either flexibility or a good balance between speed and freshness.
- We need at least one way to publish/resolve from the browser.

## Where to learn about it
