## Challenges :

**How to link Users/Apps to IPFS?** <br>
long-term solution: all IPFS, request clients as IPFS nodes; Current solution: using a gateway. However, the gateway is bottleneck usually <br/>

**Gateway is not only the bottleneck**  
Except of gateway, we still need to think about
- SLA
- User authentication
- Billing & Invoices
- Storage provider quality monitoring
- Content management
- Data deletion capacity 

for business users

With all these in mind, *A new service layer is required*. This layer could be build on IPFS.


**Force Platform - A service layer over IPFS**

The objective of Force Platform is set up a new layer to support business use.

There are 4 types of players in the sharing storage eco-system.
- Administrator:  the admin for sharing storage market, just like Uber in taxi market, responsible for providing SLA, billing, monitoring, user authentication, miner evaluation, etc.
- Miners: Storage providers who make money via data saving and retrieving
- Business Application Owners: to develop application based on ForceFS, responsible for end user management, user quota, content compliance, etc. 
- End Users: Users to use business applications, who will access the ForceFS directly via Apps

*Thanks Molly for taking notes*, which is pretty good, and the most interesting thing is that the Force platform is to be built as IPFs-Filecoin bridge next.
