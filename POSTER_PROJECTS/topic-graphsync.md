# Graphsync

A protocol to synchronize graphs across peers.

## Goal

Use whatever resources available to you, in order to come up with a visual representation of the topic that can be projected on to a poster (similar in spirit to the [poster description](README.md#description) but with whatever creative freedom your group prefers :^)

## Questions to Answer

- How does it relate to other systems (bitswap, IPLD)? 
- What benefit does it give us? 

## Where to learn about it
