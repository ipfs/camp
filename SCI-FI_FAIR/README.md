Keep in mind that _space is limited_, but we will try to accommodate as many projects as we can.

Don't worry if your presentation lacks polish or not everything works 100% of the time: what we're looking for is **experimental**, innovative, unexpected — and maybe a little bit of the impossible. Conversation starters, not pitch decks. And if something breaks, chances are your neighbors will be eager to help you fix it! 🤓

### Presenters

If you've been selected as a presenter, congratulations! You'll need to bring (at minimum) a PC/laptop/whatever your demo runs on. We will provide a power hookup, a monitor (on request), and potentially other small supplies: if you have an interesting presentation idea, let us know! This isn't meant to be a boring old poster session (not to be confused with the [not-at-all-boring Poster Projects](../../POSTER_PROJECTS/README.md)) so **be creative!** You can also bring swag, within reason (stickers, patches, etc)

A projector will be running a slideshow in the room throughout the event, so if you have one, please provide a logo, promo image, or short clip/animation (<10s) that we can include.

The fair runs for 2 hours (1630-1830) on the last day of the conference, which is the same time as the Unconf, so you may want to assign 2-3 people in shifts (if possible) so everyone gets a chance to walk around and see everything else.

### Everyone Else

If you're just visiting, relax, check out the projects, and don't be shy! Everyone standing by a table is dying to hear your questions, seriously.


### Overview

- **Objective**: Give a wide selection of projects (internal PL work and community members) to present their work in a relaxed environment, so every attendee can engage with projects they are particularly interested in on their own time, as well as see a broader overview of the ecosystem than is possible in a strictly chronological single-stream presentation format
- **Activity**: Presenters operate a smnall "station" showcasing their project, usually in an interactive and engaging way. Attendees can wander around at their leisure.
- **Outcome**: Many new relationships formed. People learn about projects both new and old.

### How

1-2 dozen tables, each presenting a project. Fair runs for 2 hours on Saturday (1630-1830), opposite the [Unconference](../../UNCONF/README.md)

### FAQ

Q: What if I'm the only rep of my project at the Camp? Can I walk away from my station/see the Unconf?

A: No problem! We ask you to be in attendance for at least a full hour of the fair. After that, your project can be in a more autonomous/self-explanatory mode (it may help to print a supplementary explanation for when you're away, too)

---

Q: My demo can be presented unattended before/after the Fair, is that possible?

A: Great! Please note this in your rider form (above) and we'll do our best to make it run throughout the event

---

Q: My project involves lasers/heavy machinery/strobing lights/etc

A: AWESOME! Do note this in your rider form, though

---

Q: I need a budget of €X to make this happen

A: Mention that in the EQUIPMENT section and we can talk :)
