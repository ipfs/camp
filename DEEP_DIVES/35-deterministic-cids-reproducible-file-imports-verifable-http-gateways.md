# Deterministic CIDs! Reproducible File Imports! Verifable HTTP Gateways!

How to deterministically get the same CID for the same data, even if ipfs.add defaults change? How can we validate data read via HTTP Gateway without running full IPFS node? https://github.com/ipfs/roadmap/issues/19#issuecomment-494529255 https://github.com/ipfs/in-web-browsers/issues/128

## Goal

<Define what we would get if the Open Problem(s) are solved for this Deep Dive>

## Requirements to consider

<Do we have requirements (i.e. work with 1MM nodes)?>

## Where to learn about it

<List of talks, links to github issues, code, notes and so on>
