## What you will learn with this Course

- Providing: How it works. XOR distance and other people's routing tables, providing strategies: all, roots, pins, and their trade-offs (DHT size if we all announce all blocks)
- Pinning: direct, recursive, transitive, MFS root best effort. IPFS command are transparent to which node happens to provide them. I can pin other peopleâ€™s blocks before they are in my local blockstore.
- Deleting: GC strategies.  current, proposed, help wanted. Do-not-replicate lists proposal, help wanted.
