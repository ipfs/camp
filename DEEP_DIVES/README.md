# üêã Deep Dives

## Description

The Deep Dives format is designed to give all participants a taste of what it feels like to work on the big and meaty Open Problems by contributing directly to them in an intense design session - evaluating all the possible solutions, their advantages and shortcomings, and documenting the results.

This type of discussion is core to the genesis of IPFS. We‚Äôve done multiple over the years which have yielded many valuable results such as IPLD, PubSub, GraphSync and other advancements to the original IPFS protocol.

These design sessions are not about explaining how things work, they were focused on finding the solution with the knowledge and resources we had available.

## Instructions

### Overview

- **Objective**: Deep knowledge transfer that only happens in synchronous interactions.
- **Activity**: In a group of max 4 people, dive deep on a complex technical design topic.
- **Outcome**: The output of each of these sessions would be a RFC like document (can be very raw) that describes the proposed solution (even if with known shortcomings), or it could be a map of all the important concepts, obstacles, and related topics you covered in the session.

### How

- **Duration**: 1:45h

On the day, this is how y'all will Deep Dive üêã:

1. Large cards with [Deep Dive topics](#topics) will be displayed
1. You **choose a deep dive** to participate in and **take a slip** from the card
1. Groups assemble and the **topic owner explains the problem**
    1. Existing solutions should be briefly enumerated!
1. Groups discuss their topic
    1. New ideas are suggested üí≠
    1. Groups **aim to come up one good solution**
        1. It can be a completely new solution or a change/fix to an existing one
1. After 1 hour, groups take a **10 minute break** (phew) ‚òïÔ∏è
1. Groups reconvene and **send a PR to [ipfs/camp](https://github.com/ipfs/camp/tree/master/DEEP_DIVES) with their proposal**
    1. Didn't come up with any solutions?
        1. List your ideas, and why they weren't suitable so we can bootstrap future discussions
1. Groups **customise their slide for presenting their solution** at the graduation ceremony
1. Groups are free to iterate on their PR or their slide overnight

The next day (graduation day), this is what happens:

1. Each group gets **2 minutes to present a summary of your solution**
1. You get **one slide** in the shared slide deck
1. The best solution(s) win an award üèÜ

FUSE support is [here](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/blob/v0.4.21-rc3/docs/fuse.md). What are current limitations, challenges? What needs to happen to enable mounting of MFS? WebDAV is often used in network storage drives, and mainstream operating systems come with native support for mounting WebDAV as drives. It could supersede Writable Gateway and create a surface for interop with apps that provide built-in client-side support for WebDAV. https://github.com/ipfs/in-web-browsers/issues/146 |
| [IPNS link rot](./34-ipns-link-rot.md) | <a href="https://github.com/alanshaw"><img src="https://github.com/alanshaw.png?size=200" alt="alanshaw" width="100" /></a> | **[@alanshaw](https://github.com/alanshaw)** | Right now, IPNS needs to be refreshed by original publisher every day, otherwise it stops working. There should be a way to pin IPNS address so that other peers keep refreshing the last valid entry when original node goes offline, keeping the last version alive even if the original publisher disappears forever. |

| [Better NAT traversal so that Relay servers are a last (not first) resort](./40-better-nat-traversal-so-that-relay-servers-are-a-last-not-first-resort.md) | <a href="https://github.com/raulk"><img src="https://github.com/raulk.png?size=200" alt="raulk" width="100" /></a> | **[@raulk](https://github.com/raulk)** | The current cost of running relay servers for IPFS is unsustainable.  We need to implement better NAT hole punching mechanisms in libp2p to reduce the usage of relay servers by NAT‚Äôd hosts.  TCP hole punching has a success rate of ~60%, so we should be preferentially hole punching.  TCP simultaneous open is one example.  STUN servers are another example; yet another is making every non-NATed host in a libp2p network a relay node. |
| [libp2p message orientation](./42-libp2p-message-orientation.md) | <a href="https://github.com/bigs"><img src="https://github.com/bigs.png?size=200" alt="bigs" width="100" /></a> | **[@bigs](https://github.com/bigs)** | libp2p is currently stream-oriented. We want to enable message-oriented communication (e.g. UDP). Help us envision what the APIs would look like, and how an application could simultaneously hold stream-based and message-based conversations with peers in the world via libp2p. |

Use cases, verifiable state transitions, aggregations and bulk updates, etc. |
| [Building Dynamic P2P Applications](./45-building-dynamic-p2p-applications.md) | <a href="https://github.com/jkarni"><img src="https://github.com/jkarni.png?size=200" alt="jkarni" width="100" /></a> | **[@jkarni](https://github.com/jkarni)** | IPFS and its associated technologies are mostly static. Radicle is an attempt to build a dynamic P2P web on top of IPFS; one which can host applications with the same abilities of the centralized servers of today to receive inputs from various people or sources. |
| [Better file chunking üì¶](./46-better-file-chunking.md) | <a href="https://github.com/mib-kd743naq"><img src="https://github.com/mib-kd743naq.png?size=200" alt="mib-kd743naq" width="100" /></a> | **[@mib-kd743naq](https://github.com/mib-kd743naq)** | Within the IPFS stack/ecosystem, just as within computing as a whole, an uncompressed stream of untagged octets is a fundamental unit of exchange. As a general-purpose data storage system IPFS needs to handle an unbounded variety of content represented by such streams. Handling the maximum amount of this variety efficiently ( ideally by default ) would likely have an outsized impact on the future adoption of IPFS as a long-term data interchange medium/format. |
