# JS-IPFS Infrastructure

This poster should cover what it takes to initialize a JS-IPFS node, and connect it to a public P2P network.

## Goal

Use whatever resources available to you, in order to come up with a visual representation of the topic that can be projected on to a poster (similar in spirit to the [poster description](README.md#description) but with whatever creative freedom your group prefers :^)

## Questions to Answer

 - How does JS-IPFS establish connections?
   - What technologies (websockets, etc.)
   - How is bootstrapping handled
 - What limitations are imposed by different environments?
   - browsers, nodejs, etc.
