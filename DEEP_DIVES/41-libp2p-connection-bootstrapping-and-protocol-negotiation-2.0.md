# libp2p connection bootstrapping and protocol negotiation 2.0

Our connection bootstrapping process is chatty and inefficient. We incur in several round trips upfront just to negotiate the basics (encryption, muxing). Stream-level protocol negotiation is also inefficient. We are working on Multiselect 2.0 and a revamped connection bootstrapping process. This is the very heart of libp2p. Help us get this right.

## Goal

<Define what we would get if the Open Problem(s) are solved for this Deep Dive>

## Requirements to consider

<Do we have requirements (i.e. work with 1MM nodes)?>

## Where to learn about it

<List of talks, links to github issues, code, notes and so on>
