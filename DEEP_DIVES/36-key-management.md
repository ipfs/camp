# Key Management

How it works today? Where we need to be? Eg: `ipfs key` is missing primitives for signing and verifying things using keys, we dont have interop for key import/export, keys are stored unencrypted on disk etc. I see this as "where we are"+"what devs need" â†’ "where we need to be for 1.0"  type of dive, producing some tangible AIs

## Goal

<Define what we would get if the Open Problem(s) are solved for this Deep Dive>

## Requirements to consider

<Do we have requirements (i.e. work with 1MM nodes)?>

## Where to learn about it

<List of talks, links to github issues, code, notes and so on>
