Textile, lower the permission and roles system from ~15 methods to 2
Also did that on a number of large scale apps throughout the years.

# Design Patterns for DWeb Apps
UX/design workshop. Pick any difficult IPFS problem. We'll draft a simple, ready to implement solution.

## Goal
The goal is something ready to code for an update.
I've done this exercise with the Textile team, where we changed the permissions and roles model from ~15 cases to 2. Tons of code and education saved!
Intend to achieve the same with another app during this workshop.

## Requirements to consider
Have a problem that requires UX/design thinking!
