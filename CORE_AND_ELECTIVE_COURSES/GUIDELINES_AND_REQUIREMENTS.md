 # Guidelines & Requirements

Welcome to the Core & Elective Courses Guidelines and Requirements, if you are reading this doc, it is probable that you have been selected to run either a core or elective training session for IPFS Camp, congratulations!

The Core & Elective Courses are a big component for our InterPlanetary Space Training Program (aka IPFS Camp). It is in these that the new IPNauts will have the chance to develop a good breath of understanding on the main building blocks of the DWeb (Core Courses) and develop specializations in their areas of interest (Elective Courses).

There is no strict format for these courses, however, our internal seasoned trainers have developed a series of guidelines for you to have in mind when developing these, so that you avoid falling in known pitfalls and optimize the time with your cadets!

**Starting off with some numbers**
- Length of the course: 75 mins length, 5 min buffer, 10 minute break
- Number of attendees: max 30 (expect 20~24)
- Number of trainers: max 3 (recommended minimum 3)

**Requirements Overview**
- All material development must be developed beforehand and tested
- The course content should be reusable by itself without the presence of its creator
- Participants should form teams of 2 to 4 to execute the exercises of the course
- Must be fun! - To achieve this, we recommend starting with an interesting demo to set context and put later technical content into perspective
  - Example: Check out this great visualizer and talk by [Philip Roberts showing how the JS event loop works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGhZQkoFbQ)

**Ideas and other things to have in mind**
- Pairing up participants increases the number of relationships built, reduces the fear of failing alone, and overall just makes it more enjoyable
- Everyone will come with a different OS (Windows, Linux, Mac), if your Workshop requires some installation of software, make sure it can be completed in all platforms otherwise you risk spending all your time debugging it.

### Where to draw inspiration from

We are big fans of http://nodeschool.io, so much that we even created http://proto.school. If you are unfamiliar with nodeschool, you can learn a bit of its story and success at CascadiaJS 2014 A Story About NodeSchool and Community Building Jason Rhodes and see the explosion of NodeSchool meetups all over the world with the NodeSchool Internacional Recap.

You can optionally use http://proto.school (Web interface) or http://nodeschool.io (Terminal Interface) to help you create the Workshop if useful.

You can also take inspiration from Workshops the IPFS Community has created in the past:
  - DWeb Summit 2019 Workshops
    - [Building Dynamic Apps on the Distributed Web (slidedeck)](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1WAYm2jvGYxPI4Tu1ZMuSDws_K8FXlwYag-Fbi2UK584/edit)
  - [TODO App (Building Dynamic Apps with CRDTs and IPFS)](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/workshop-todo-dapp)
    - [A talk that does it Live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PQ3Q-Z691I)
  - [Tutorial: How to build an application with IPFS PubSub Room](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nv_Teb--1zg)

## Preparing to deliver Technical Workshops, notes from field experience

We’ve created this section to share with you some of the insights we acquired over time when preparing technical workshops. These are most based in our experience as organizers and attendees.

### The preparation checklist

Before coming to the event, create a checklist (expand the one below) to ensure that you don’t forget anything. A #protip is to run through the checklist multiple times and ensure that the answers to the questions are the ones that yield the best result.

- [ ] Does your Workshop require a specific Runtime? 
  - [ ] If OS. Does it work on Windows, Linux & Mac OS?
  - [ ] If Browser. Does it work on Chrome & Firefox?
- [ ] How are the attendees receiving update on what they need to do to prep?
  - [ ] Email send one week before
  - [ ] Email sent 2 days before
- [ ] How can attendees reach out to you to iron any kinks from the preparation? (See Setting up the Help Desk)
- [ ] While designing your Course, did you do it with the assumption that everything can go wrong? If yes, then
  - [ ] Does it require Internet? What happens if there is no Internet access => Bring your own Internet (Hotspot or similar)
  - [ ] Does it require Wifi? What happens if the Wifi of the venue is down => Bring your own router
- [ ] Bring USB sticks with whatever attendees need to install or access (slidedecks, instructions).
- [ ] Set up roles for the team before hand:
  - [ ] Who is Leading?
  - [ ] Who is Live Coding / Hacking
  - [ ] Who is providing support to the Room?

### Delivering the Content

- [ ] Mitigate OS hiccups by pairing folks together. (e.g. get the Windows people to pair with the Linux/Mac OS people, if those are the 2 OS that work best with your content)
- [ ] Have a Pilot & a Co-Pilot. Previous experience suggests that having one person doing the explanations while the other one does the Live Coding (if any) yields best results. This has 2 main benefits:
  - Attendees see what exactly are instructions and what are insights (as the Co-Pilot will only do what is actually instructions)
  - Attendees will see what they have to replicate.

### Setting up a Help Desk

We will have a space after dinner where attendees can meet with Course Organizers to get set up. This shouldn’t take more than 30 minutes and it is also an opportunity for the attendees to meet the Trainers before the day.
