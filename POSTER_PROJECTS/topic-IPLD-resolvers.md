# IPLD Resolvers

IPLD resolvers handle IPLD formatted objects via a common interface, allowing for cross compatibility between formats and resolvers, without the need to worry about node implementation specifics.

## Goal

Use whatever resources available to you, in order to come up with a visual representation of the topic that can be projected on to a poster (similar in spirit to the [poster description](README.md#description) but with whatever creative freedom your group prefers :^)

## Questions to Answer

- What layer of IPLD do resolvers relate to?
- What formats can be resolved via IPLD implementations today?
- What's the relation between IPLD formats and the IPLD resolver interface?
