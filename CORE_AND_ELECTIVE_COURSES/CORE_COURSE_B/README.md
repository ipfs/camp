## What you will learn with this Course

In this course, attendees will build a libp2p application. The course will cover:
- Transport, Stream Muxer and Crypto Configuration
- Composition of multiaddrs
- Creating a custom protocol
- Peer discovery with Bootstrap, MDNS and DHT Random Walk
- Message broadcasting with Pubsub
- Leveraging protobuf to create versatile messaging
- Subnet discovery leveraging the DHT

## Preparation for the course

The course will give you the opportunity to build your application for one of three platforms/languages: Go, Node.js, and Web Browsers. See the preparation section below for your respective choice.

1. Have your favorite code editor ready, such as [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com)

### Preparing for Go

Everyone will need a working go 1.12 installation. Beyond that, feel free to study up on the basic concepts on the [libp2p website](http://docs.libp2p.io/) and study the interfaces in [go-libp2p-core](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-core).

### Preparing for JS

1. Node.js >= 10 installed
1. npm >= 6 installed
1. Download or clone the code at https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-examples, `git clone https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-examples.git`.

#### Node.js

1. Install dependencies by following the Setup directions at https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-examples/tree/master/chat/nodejs#setup.

#### Web Browsers

1. Have a Web Browser installed. The chat example was built and tested with [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/new/).
1. Install dependencies by following the Setup directions at https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-examples/tree/master/chat/browser#setup.
