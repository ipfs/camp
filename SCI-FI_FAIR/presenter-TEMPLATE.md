# What is the NAME of your project?
_Please specify the name of the project as it would be shown in a brand guidelines document._

# What DOES THE PROJECT DO/what will you SHOW?
_Briefly explain your madcap decentralized science experiment and why it will excite and inspire the fair attendees :)_

# WHO will PRESENT the project?
_PREFERRED NAME(S) and CONTACT EMAIL(S), please. The fair takes place 16:30 - 18:30 on Saturday, booked against the Unconference, so we recommend assigning 2-3 people in shifts, if possible. If you'll need to leave your post unattended for part of the time, please note that._ 

# WHAT EQUIPMENT will you need?
_The standard equipment is a table with a power strip. We can provide a MONITOR if needed (specify it now so we can rent one). OTHER EQUIPMENT or materials can also be provided within reason -- we want this fair to be distinctly more fun than the average conference poster session so creative execution ideas are welcome! Please include any ASSISTIVE DEVICES needed._

# Do you have a LOGO/HERO IMAGE for the main projector?
_Please link an image you'd like shown in the slideshow on the main projector in this Fair room (1280 x 720 or higher resolution image or 720p video loop/gif of <10sec)_

# Any other QUESTIONS or SUGGESTIONS?
_for sensitive concerns please email arkadiy [at] protocol.ai_
