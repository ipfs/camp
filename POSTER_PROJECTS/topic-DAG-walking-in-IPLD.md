# DAG walking in IPLD

The goal of IPLD is to enable decentralized data-structures that are universally addressable and linkable which in turn will enable more decentralized applications. These hypergeneric data-structures allow us to do for data what hyperlinks did for HTML web pages.

## Goal

Use whatever resources available to you, in order to come up with a visual representation of the topic that can be projected on to a poster (similar in spirit to the [poster description](README.md#description) but with whatever creative freedom your group prefers :^)

## Questions to Answer

- What layer of IPLD does DAG traversal relate to?
- What's the relation between path's and DAG's?
- How does one traverse a path using IPLD?
- How are multiple formats handled?
