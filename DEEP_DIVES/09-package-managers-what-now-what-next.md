# Package Managers: What Now, What Next?

Community evaluation and ideation session to recap the current (as of late June) state of the IPFS-enabled package manager landscape, discuss happiness and pain points, and do some ideation/co-creation around the direction of our next rounds of package manager efforts.

## Goal

We'll use what we learn during this session to help refine (or re-define, if necessary) our roadmap for package manager efforts over the second half of 2019.

## Requirements to consider

No specific requirements, since this is a discussion-based ideation session, but you'll get the most out of this session if you read about some of our foundational work on package managers so far in the [IPFS Package Managers Working Group](https://github.com/ipfs/package-managers) repo.
