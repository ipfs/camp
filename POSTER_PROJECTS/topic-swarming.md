# Swarming

Swarming (also known as segmented-transfer and multisource-transfer) is a software method that takes advantage of multiple peers (the "swarm") to fulfill a task which may be easily distributed.

An example of this is multiple peers providing redundant access to a file, often resulting in higher throughput and simpler replication.

## Goal

Use whatever resources available to you, in order to come up with a visual representation of the topic that can be projected on to a poster (similar in spirit to the [poster description](README.md#description) but with whatever creative freedom your group prefers :^)

## Questions to Answer

- How do swarms compare to central systems?
- What benefits can a swarm provide that a central system could not?
- What are some applications that benefit from swarming?
- How does IPFS use swarming concepts?
