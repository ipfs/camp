# PeerPad
PeerPad is a decentralized editor that allows concurrent writing of text. Besides making live changes to a given document, it allows read-only nodes to follow the changes in real-time.

## Goal

Use whatever resources available to you, in order to come up with a visual representation of the topic that can be projected on to a poster (similar in spirit to the [poster description](README.md#description) but with whatever creative freedom your group prefers :^)

## Questions to Answer

<Series of questions which the group should try to answer>

- What technologies does PeerPad use? (libp2p, CRDTs, etc.)
- How do these technologies map to features of the project?
- What are other uses of these patterns?
