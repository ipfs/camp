# ⚡️ Lightning Talks

## Description

Lightning talks are one of the most entertaining and inspiring features of IPFS Camp! These short (five-minute!) presentations from members of the greater IPFS community serve to enable a wide range of camp attendees to share updates on their own projects with the whole community. Lightning talks are designed for high throughput, high velocity, and wide subject matter coverage.

## Instructions

**Want to give a lightning talk at IPFS Camp? Here's what you need to do.**

- Think of a great subject for your talk! (Hints for this are below.) We're reaching out to some attendees directly who have already approached us with lightning talk ideas, but if you didn't already do so, email jessica@protocol.ai with a quick summary of your idea and why you think camp attendees would benefit from hearing about it.
- Once you get an OK from the IPFS Camp team, put together your presentation (don't forget to practice it!) and send it to us as a PDF, Keynote, PowerPoint or Google Slides deck. Remember to include any embedded photos, videos, or custom fonts so you don't end up with any surprises on the big screen. We'll send you a link to a Google Drive where you can store your beautiful finished files.
- A note on live demos: These can get tricky because of all the plugging/unplugging (it takes time, it's boring to your audience, and things don't always work as intended). For this reason, we ask that _unless you're presenting something that specifically benefits from a live, interactive demo, please embed your demo into your deck as an animated GIF or movie_. Macs can easily do video screen grabs in QuickTime, or for capturing terminal sessions, [asciinema](https://asciinema.org/) is a good choice for a variety of OSes. If you still want to do a live demo, please be aware that we'll probably schedule you toward the end of the lightning talk sessions due to the inherent riskiness of cord-swapping.
- **Presentations are really, really due when we open our computers on the morning of Monday, June 24**. We know deadlines are tough, but this deadline enables us to make sure we have everything ready for you when you arrive at IPFS Camp -- it's our deadline, too!

**Here are some tips on how to create an excellent lightning talk ...**
- Five minutes may seem like a long time, but really, it isn't. If you've never given a lightning talk before, maybe use this rule of thumb: Outline what you want to tell your audience about ... and then cut it down by half. If you end up with extra time, that's great! More opportunities for Q&A, brainstorming or just high-fives to the front row.
- We'll be publishing videos of individual talks after IPFS Camp. That's great news for your project, your tech, your company and you, because YouTube notoriety awaits! But because you'll be video'd for your five minutes of fame, you don't want to forget that practice makes perfect.
- While everyone in attendance at IPFS Camp has been hand-selected for dweb enthusiasm, evangelism and expertise, people's subject matter knowledge does vary quite a bit, as do individual learning styles, caffeine intake on any given day, or fluency in your home country's awesome but obscure cultural references. When you put together your presentation, cast it to a wide audience; if attendees want to zoom in deeper with you, there'll be plenty of opportunities to do so during camp.
- And finally: No pitch decks! If you want to tell us about the awesome thing your org/company is building, that's great. If we look at your deck and it makes us feel like you're pitching to us, we're going to tell you to try again. (Also, that's great if you're hiring, but this is not the venue to actively promote that! If your talk is sufficiently amazing, folks will look you up and find your job posts. Trust us on this one.)

## Overview

- **Objective**: Create a venue for many projects, subjects and ideas to disseminate across the entire set of IPFS Camp attendees.
- **Activity**: Individuals (or small teams) give pre-prepared 5-minute presentations on their projects, research, ideas, proposals or other items of interest to the IPFS community at large.
- **Outcome**: Camp attendees gain a shared context to operate from. Both attendees and non-attendees can view recordings of all presentations, plus their associated slides, after the camp.

## How

Short presentations (5 minutes) in rapid succession. Folks send their slides by June 24 in order to be included.

Participants will have the chance to propose lightning talks in advance.
