# What DOES THE PROJECT DO/what will you SHOW?
The Gathering was designed to make networking at conferences like IPFS Camp easier and more fun. It's focused on aiding in-person connections by making it easy for people to swap contact info and recommend other potential contacts. To keep contact info private, we use p2p connections between devices to swap contact info.
