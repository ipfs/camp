# IPLD Selectors

IPLD Selectors are expressions that identify ("select") a subset of nodes in an IPLD dag. i.e. subsets of IPLD objects.

## Goal

Use whatever resources available to you, in order to come up with a visual representation of the topic that can be projected on to a poster (similar in spirit to the [poster description](README.md#description) but with whatever creative freedom your group prefers :^)

## Questions to Answer

- What layer of IPLD do selectors relate to?
- What's the relation between path's and DAG's?
- What are some applications of a selector?
