Community evaluation and ideation session to recap the current (as of late June) state of the IPFS-enabled package manager landscape, discuss happiness and pain points, and do some ideation/co-creation  around the direction of our next rounds of package manager efforts.

## Goal

<Define what we would get if the Open Problem(s) are solved for this Deep Dive>

## Requirements to consider

<Do we have requirements (i.e. work with 1MM nodes)?>

## Where to learn about it

<List of talks, links to github issues, code, notes and so on>
