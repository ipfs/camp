# Mounting an IPFS filesystem

Is there a way to efficiently mount IPFS as a filesystem? FUSE support is [here](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/blob/v0.4.21-rc3/docs/fuse.md). What are current limitations, challenges? What needs to happen to enable mounting of MFS? WebDAV is often used in network storage drives, and mainstream operating systems come with native support for mounting WebDAV as drives. It could supersede Writable Gateway and create a surface for interop with apps that provide built-in client-side support for WebDAV. https://github.com/ipfs/in-web-browsers/issues/146

## Goal

<Define what we would get if the Open Problem(s) are solved for this Deep Dive>

## Requirements to consider

<Do we have requirements (i.e. work with 1MM nodes)?>

## Where to learn about it

<List of talks, links to github issues, code, notes and so on>
