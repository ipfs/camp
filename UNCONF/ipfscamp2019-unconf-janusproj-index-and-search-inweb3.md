## Why IPFS?
### Documentation
After analyzing some similar technologies we found IPFS Documentation the most complete and trustable.
### Decentralized
We were looking for a total decentralized and distributed technology as long as a trustable network with some applications already being used
### Integrated.
In our experience, to integrate the project to IPFS was easy and viable as the Docs were very helpful
### File Storage.
We managed to use IPFS as a File Storage for any kind of web application.
### SPA Host
IPFS was used as a Web Server making it possible to distribute our DAPPs as well. 
<br/>
## Janus Platform
We build a set of tools to help to build the decentralized web.
<br/>
### Indexer: JANUSNDXR and Janus web app
It is a easy way to publish and index your web site in the decentralized web.<br/>
We use a Ethereum Smart Contract to index the keywords present at index.html in website.<br/>
#### JANUSNDXR (Janus-CLI)
It is a Command Line Interface (CLI), for technical users, with some knowledge on development.<br/> 
More types of apps and make the process of deploy fast and easy thru the terminal.<br/> 
#### Janus web app
This is a DApp with a friendly interface making it easy to upload and index Web 3.0 content.<br/>  
It is intuitive and communicate directly with the blockchain being needless to use command lines or technical blockchain knowledge.<br/> 
### Search: Janus Searcher
Here the users can explore the Web 3.0. <br/>
We made a platform validated by the most recent UX techniques to make our searcher intuitive and comfortable for the users. <br/>
You can enter keywords and find all pages related to it, as usual in most search interfaces now a days. <br/>
