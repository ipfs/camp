# What is the NAME of your project?
IPFS and Ham Radio

# What DOES THE PROJECT DO/what will you SHOW?
An amateur radio, ad-hoc APRS network with RaspberryPis and Baofeng UV-82s. Each Pi plus Baofeng will act as an APRS digital repeater (in the VHF band), WiFi hotspot/webserver, and an IPFS file server.

FAPRS - F# for APRS, a system I wrote to construct, schedule, and manage APRS messages.

The system will attempt to model an emergency communications system that uses Ham Broadband mesh networks and APRS VHF radio communications to distribute messages and share data.

# WHO will PRESENT the project?
Me, Marnee Dearman. Github handle MarneeDear.

# WHAT EQUIPMENT will you need?
1. Table and power strip
2. Monitor 
3. I will provide handheld radios and RaspberryPi 3s.

# Do you have a LOGO/HERO IMAGE for the main projector?

# Any other QUESTIONS or SUGGESTIONS?
If I bring a second radio or a set of walkie talkies, my demo can be very interactive. I might be able to do this.
