# 🧩 Unconf

## Description

We will host an Unconf segment during IPFS Camp to create space for all the conversations, talks, discussions and idea sharing that didn’t get the opportunity to be discussed during the other sessions. 
Instructions

## Overview

- **Objective: Create a space to host all sorts of discussions to be had in person that didn’t fit all the other sessions
- **Activity**: Each participant gets to propose sessions or attend sessions from others.
- **Outcome**: The results from the unconf sessions should be uploaded to the IPFS Camp repo by the session attendees.

## How

Unconf sessions will be proposed on the event itself. There will be a wide board with available slots in which folks can propose and vote for the sessions.
