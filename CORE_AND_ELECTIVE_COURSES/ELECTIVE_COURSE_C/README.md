## What you will learn with this Course

In this course, you will learn the basic for serial communication using a high level framework (johnny-five) we will then explore together possible ways to bridge this with peer to peer technologies

- use actuators (servo, laser)
- listen to analog input
- build a laser turret using Ikea grade instruction

## Preparation for the course

there are test bases exercises available using javascript and nodejs so recommendations will focus on this language, but anything that can play nice with serial and MCU (python,  go, etc) could work.

### prerequisite
- nodejs, preferably installed using a version manager like [n](https://github.com/tj/n) or [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
- if you uses windows a driver may be needed for the arduino to be sure please install the [arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/windows)
- on linux you will need the "build essential" package
	- ```sudo apt-get update```
   - ```sudo apt-get install build-essential```

#### resources
   - [micropython on esp](https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/esp8266/tutorial/intro.html)
   - controll an arduino with go using [gobot](https://gobot.io/documentation/platforms/arduino/)
   
I'll be around in the scifi fair close to things that blink or make noise, don't hesitate to ping if you want to test your setup beforehand / have any issue preparing your computer
