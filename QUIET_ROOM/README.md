# üêö QUIET_ROOM


## Description

The quiet room is a place for resting, reflecting, and taking space from the excitement of camp. Let your brain cool after a full day of learning.

## Instructions

Come to the room, interact with the art installation, listen to the birds, meditate, fall asleep, dream you're a lichen growing on a granite rock, an ant crawling across a circuit board, a whale serenading a deep sea cable. There's no way to do it wrong.

**Have an idea for something to contribute to the quiet room? Open a pr, we welcome suggestions!**

## Art

There will be an art installation in the quiet room called [Seed Me Forever](art-SeedMeForever.md)
