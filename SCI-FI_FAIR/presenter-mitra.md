# What is the NAME of your project?
Universal Library - Internet Archive on a RPI

# What DOES THE PROJECT DO/what will you SHOW?
Trying to bring the Internet Archive's content and UI to people where the net is poor (slow, expensive, censored).
I've built a subset of the IA UI that runs off of machines as small as an RPI 
Or it could be a server running a subset of the IA
It proxies, caches, and crawls and can also integrate with IPFS, WebTorrent etc since its based on the dweb.archive.org libraries.

# WHO will PRESENT the project?
Mitra Ardron, mitra@archive.org

# WHAT EQUIPMENT will you need?
Raspberry Pi - I'll need a monitor, but could bring small one from IA

# Do you have a LOGO/HERO IMAGE for the main projector?
It would be the Internet Archive logo

# Any other QUESTIONS or SUGGESTIONS?
