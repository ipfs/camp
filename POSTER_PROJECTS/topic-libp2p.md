# Libp2p Connection Flow

Libp2p uses a multitude of techniques and protocols to connect peers together. This poster should detail and display the process and components used to accomplish this.

## Goal

Use whatever resources available to you, in order to come up with a visual representation of the topic that can be projected on to a poster (similar in spirit to the [poster description](README.md#description) but with whatever creative freedom your group prefers :^)

## Questions to Answer

<Series of questions which the group should try to answer>

- What is the connection flow of a libp2p connection?
- How does libp2p handle dialing and connection management internally?
