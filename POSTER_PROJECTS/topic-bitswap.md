# Bitswap

Bitswap is the data trading module for IPFS. Its purpose is to request blocks from and send blocks to other peers in the network. Bitswap has two primary jobs:

1.  Attempt to acquire blocks from the network that have been requested by the client.
2.  Judiciously (though strategically) send blocks in its possession to other peers who want them.


## Goal

Use whatever resources available to you, in order to come up with a visual representation of the topic that can be projected on to a poster (similar in spirit to the [poster description](README.md#description) but with whatever creative freedom your group prefers :^)

## Questions to Answer

- What is Bitswap 1.0.0 vs Bitswap 1.1.0?
- Does it use "tit-for-tat" negotiation?
