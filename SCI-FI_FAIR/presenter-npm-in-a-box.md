# What is the NAME of your project?
npm in a box

# What DOES THE PROJECT DO/what will you SHOW?
npm in a box is your own personal mirror for the public npm registry running on a Raspberry Pi connected to your local network.

Control your own little corner of the JavaScript Commons and install packages from it using [`ipfs-npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ipfs-npm)

Also use it to publish [IPNS](https://docs.ipfs.io/guides/concepts/ipns/) names for your own modules published on IPFS!

# WHO will PRESENT the project?
_PREFERRED NAME(S) and CONTACT EMAIL(S), please. The fair takes place 16:30 - 18:30 on Saturday, booked against the Unconference, so we recommend assigning 2-3 people in shifts, if possible. If you'll need to leave your post unattended for part of the time, please note that._ 

# WHAT EQUIPMENT will you need?
Just a table & somewhere to plug the pi in.

# Do you have a LOGO/HERO IMAGE for the main projector?
