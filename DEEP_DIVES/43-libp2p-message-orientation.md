# libp2p message orientation

libp2p is currently stream-oriented. We want to enable message-oriented communication (e.g. UDP). Help us envision what the APIs would look like, and how an application could simultaneously hold stream-based and message-based conversations with peers in the world via libp2p.

## Goal

<Define what we would get if the Open Problem(s) are solved for this Deep Dive>

## Requirements to consider

<Do we have requirements (i.e. work with 1MM nodes)?>

## Where to learn about it

<List of talks, links to github issues, code, notes and so on>
