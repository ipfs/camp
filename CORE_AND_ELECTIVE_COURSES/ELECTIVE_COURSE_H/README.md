# `Elective H` Making the Browser a True User Agent

What if your web browser truly reflected your values - advocating for you, filtering for you, connecting you to others on your terms. What if your browser could be a full nodes in a distributed networks, or just connect directly to your friend's computer without intermediaries?

While we're waiting for mainstream browsers to catch up with our needs, we can experiment with building our own. What if you could build your own browser? What would it look like? What values would it have? What capabilities would it need to have?

Weâ€™ll show how browsers act as a value filter on our world, teach some approaches to making the browser truly be an agent that represents *you*, and break into groups to start building our own *true* user agents.
