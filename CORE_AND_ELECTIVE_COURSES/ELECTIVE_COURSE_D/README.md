# `Elective D` Building DApps with Textile, the iCloud for the DWeb

> Decentralized app-development is still in its infancy, and has been notoriously difficult to get started with. That's where this workshop comes into play. Using real-world examples built on Textile's suite of developer tools, this workshop will explore the anatomy of a working DApp in a single, engaging session.

## What you will learn with this Course

The goal of this workshop is to introduce participants to tools and techniques that facilitate building real-world apps and libraries on top of IPFS. We will do this through the lens of real app development, starting with a simple p2p game/example. Using the Textile suite of developer tools, we will cover core concepts such as structured data and schemas, decentralized database handling via threads, identity, contacts, and peers, as well as various social interactions such as likes, comments, and sharing. By the end of the session, participants will have dissected a working DApp, and if they choose, extended it with their own custom interactions. We will also cover mobile app development to some degree, showcasing the ability to deploy IPFS-based apps on mobile devices.

While real-world app development is our goal, the workshop will also delve into the protocol-level details of the system. As we move from concept to implementation, participants to be able to 'pull back the layers' of the system they are building to get a better grasp of what is going on under the hood. This is critical for understanding, but also provides a way for our trainers to solicit feedback, explore new use-cases, and learn from workshop participants. We'd like to facilitate a two-way dialog between participants and trainers. As such, we will also reserve time for an open discussion to explore additional development scenarios, extensions, and ideas.

## Preparation for the course

### Requirements

Some knowledge of IPFS and DWeb concepts in general. Some development experience, though not necessarily mobile or DApps. A working laptop with a modern development setup (Nodejs, React, or even iOS would be great). That's about it. There will be working code for all examples and demos, and participants will be given developer access tokens for Textile's developer Cafes to make onboarding a bit easier.
