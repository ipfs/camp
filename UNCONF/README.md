# ðŸ§© Unconf

## Description

This year's IPFS Camp will include an _unconf_ segment to create space for all the conversations, talks, discussions and ideas that didnâ€™t get the opportunity to be discussed during the other sessions.

What's an unconf? An unconference! Unconf sessions are ad-hoc, participant-organized and participant-led open spaces to talk about any issues of importance that come up at IPFS Camp. Unconf sessions are informal, interesting, open and fun. Unconf sessions _aren't_ boring slide-fests; in fact, if you want to be an unconf host at IPFS Camp, we'd encourage you to ditch any prepared remarks or PowerPoint slides and just focus on getting a good confersation started.

## Instructions

**If you want to host an unconf session**: Start thinking of items you might want to discuss with your dweb peers -- particularly things that weren't discussed in other camp sessions, or things that were but that could benefit from some extra depth or breadth. If nothing comes immediately to mind ... keep thinking over the course of camp! Anyone can post an idea for a session on the Unconf Wall until right up before it's time to start.

**If you want to join an unconf session**: Keep an eye on the Unconf Wall for sessions that sound interesting to you! Each page posted on the wall for a proposed session will have tear-off tabs at the bottom (ever seen a "lost dog" poster? Like that), and if a session sounds like fun to you, simply tear off one of the tabs to indicate your interest (and to remind you later which sessions you might want to go to!).

## Timing

Our unconf time on Saturday will be split into two halves so that presenters will still have time to attend sessions, too:
- 16:30-17:20
- 17:30-18:20

Hosts, the Unconf Wall will have all the details you need in order to sign up for the best time for you!

## [Added post-camp] Which unconfs happened at 2019 IPFS Camp?

The full list and links to artifacts can be found in the main [README](https://github.com/ipfs/camp).

## Overview

- **Objective**: Create a space to host all sorts of discussions to be had in person that didnâ€™t fit all the other sessions, or that expand on sessions
- **Activity**: Each participant gets to propose sessions or attend sessions from others.
- **Outcome**: The results from the unconf sessions should be uploaded to the IPFS Camp repo by session hosts and/or attendees.

## How

- **Before camp**, start thinking about ideas for sessions you might want to host!
- **During camp**, check the Unconf Wall for sessions to attend, or post sessions you want to host on the wall
- **At the end of camp**, help post notes, artifacts and other results from sessions you attended or hosted right here in this repo!
