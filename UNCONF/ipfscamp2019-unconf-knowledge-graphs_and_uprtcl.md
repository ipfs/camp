# Knowledge Graphs and Underscore Protocol

We combined both sessions because of common interests.

The topology of current internet platforms and infrastructure is constraining our capacity to grow as individuals and to advance as a collective. We are in a need for tools that can interoperate and allow us to organize, share, and fork knowledge transcending these limitations.

Prior to and through the camp, several of the participants had met already. There are quite a few projects tackling these issues from different perspectives.

## Unconf event

We were a large number of participants with a wide and abstract topic to cover. The timeframe of the event it barely gives us time to expose our personal perspective with a high level of abstraction.

We agreed that defining a data model is the hardest and more critical element to resolve, but to move forward we need to outline clear use-cases. We focused on collecting use cases (awaiting notes from @JustMaier).

We have created a [Telegram group](https://t.me/knowledgegraphs) to move the conversation forward.
