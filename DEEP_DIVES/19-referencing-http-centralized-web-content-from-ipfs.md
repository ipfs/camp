# Referencing HTTP/centralized web content from IPFS

Currently data is available to the IPFS network when a node advertises that they have data and provides it upon request. Would it be useful if we could advertise data provided by HTTP? What are the tradeoffs and mitigations we would need?

## Goal

<Define what we would get if the Open Problem(s) are solved for this Deep Dive>

## Requirements to consider

<Do we have requirements (i.e. work with 1MM nodes)?>

## Where to learn about it

<List of talks, links to github issues, code, notes and so on>
