## Context :

**63 years is the healthy life expectancy**, this figure has not changed for more than 10 years ([source : WHO](https://www.who.int/gho/mortality_burden_disease/life_tables/hale/en/)). <br/>

**And you, how long do you have left in good health?**  

What about health today ?



1. Medical demographics are declining, 
2. Health care spending is increasing, 
3. Centralized and scattered health data are difficult to access for research.


**Imagine** that tomorrow **you can make your health data available, store and secure by the community !** Imagine that access to this data is facilitated and much cheaper for research by soliciting you directly !

So let's not wait another 10 years, **Medwish wants to create the alternative to today's health systems.** and we believe that the **IPFS is one of the keys to tomorrow's health**.

<br/>

## Global presentation : 

### **Medwish is a Decentralized health ecosystem, Medwish is the unification of the IPFS, a blockchain and a token economy dedicated to health.**

Medwish is :

* **A token** to be paid for access to our data and to be able to pay our health expenses,

* **A blockchain** to secure and log transactions,

* **IPFS** for massive storage.



<br/>



## Trust points :


*  **Community governance** (no conflict of interest with the medical industry).


*  **100%** of the data value is **returned to the data owners and the community**. *fee team medwish = 0%*.

*  An **ICO under the visa of the French State** [issued by the AMF (French Financial Market Authority)](https://www.amf-france.org/en_US/Acteurs-et-produits/Societes-cotees-et-operations-financieres/Offres-au-public-de-jetons-ICO?langSwitch=true).

*  **Securing funds** during the ICO and **until the Medwish network is efficient** [(see commitment paper)](https://medwish.io/en/doc/Commitment_Paper.pdf).

*  **Anonymization and respect for medical confidentiality**.
