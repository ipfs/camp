# Keystore

A secure and simple way of storing and managing keypairs (for IPFS services).

## Goal

Use whatever resources available to you, in order to come up with a visual representation of the topic that can be projected on to a poster (similar in spirit to the [poster description](README.md#description) but with whatever creative freedom your group prefers :^)

## Questions to Answer

- What is a Linked-Data key?
- What types of keys are used?
- What can you use these keys with?
- What are the use cases for signing?
