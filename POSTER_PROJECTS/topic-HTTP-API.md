# HTTP-API

IPFS nodes allow you to access them over an HTTP API. The API ensures that both IPFS core implementations and their respective HTTP client libraries offer the same interface, so that developers can quickly change between a local and a remote node without having to change their applications.

## Goal

Use whatever resources available to you, in order to come up with a visual representation of the topic that can be projected on to a poster (similar in spirit to the [poster description](README.md#description) but with whatever creative freedom your group prefers :^)

## Questions to Answer

<Series of questions which the group should try to answer>

- What applications target this API?
- What are the benefits of having a consistent API across languages?
- Are there alternatives to HTTP that offer the same interface?
