# IPNS link rot

Right now, IPNS needs to be refreshed by original publisher every day, otherwise it stops working. There should be a way to pin IPNS address so that other peers keep refreshing the last valid entry when original node goes offline, keeping the last version alive even if the original publisher disappears forever.

## Goal

<Define what we would get if the Open Problem(s) are solved for this Deep Dive>

## Requirements to consider

<Do we have requirements (i.e. work with 1MM nodes)?>

## Where to learn about it

<List of talks, links to github issues, code, notes and so on>
