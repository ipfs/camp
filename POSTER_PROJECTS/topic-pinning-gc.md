# Pinning and Garbage Collection

IPFS nodes treat the data they store like a cache, meaning that there is no guarantee that the data will continue to be stored. Pinning a CID tells an IPFS server that the data is important and mustnâ€™t be thrown away.

Conversely, data which may be disposed of is considered "garbage" that may be tossed away at any time.

## Goal

Use whatever resources available to you, in order to come up with a visual representation of the topic that can be projected on to a poster (similar in spirit to the [poster description](README.md#description) but with whatever creative freedom your group prefers :^)

## Questions to Answer

- How does an IPFS node determine what is and isn't "garbage"?
- What are the effects of pinning a hash?
