# Core API & ipfsx

High level API's that wrap various APIs like the [HTTP-API](topic-HTTP-API.md) to provide native language integrations.

## Goal

Use whatever resources available to you, in order to come up with a visual representation of the topic that can be projected on to a poster (similar in spirit to the [poster description](README.md#description) but with whatever creative freedom your group prefers :^)

## Questions to Answer

<Series of questions which the group should try to answer>

- What applications target these APIs?
- What are the benefits of having native language integration?
