# Locking the IPFS repo for concurrent access

How do we manage concurrent access to an IPFS repo when we have multiple tabs on the same domain or web workers or service workers? How do we avoid being too restrictive (i.e. locking everything) whilst guarding against race conditions and concurrency problems?

## Goal

<Define what we would get if the Open Problem(s) are solved for this Deep Dive>

## Requirements to consider

<Do we have requirements (i.e. work with 1MM nodes)?>

## Where to learn about it

<List of talks, links to github issues, code, notes and so on>
