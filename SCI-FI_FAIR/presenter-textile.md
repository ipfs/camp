# What is the NAME of your project?
Textile Photos | A digital wallet for your photos that is built on Textile's encrypted, recoverable, schema-based, and cross-application decentralized data wallet. We'll have a photo both for you take photos with friends, and share them via peer-to-peer connections at the event. There will also be a video display so you can see what's going on in real-time at the Camp. Smile!

# WHO will PRESENT the project?
Carson Farmer <carson@textile.io>, Andrew Hill <andrew@textile.io>, Ben Lupton <benjamin@textile.io>

# WHAT EQUIPMENT will you need?
Table, power-strip, monitor, and a wall or space to pose for photos and selfies ;)

# Do you have a LOGO/HERO IMAGE for the main projector?

# Any other QUESTIONS or SUGGESTIONS?
Since this will also be a photo sharing/taking booth, it would be useful to be in a relatively high-traffic area!
