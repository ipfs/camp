## What you will learn with this Course

This course will show you how to install and operate an IPFS Cluster. It will explore different ways of configuring and running IPFS Cluster peers, interacting with peers and integrating on top of them.

## Preparation for the course

You donâ€™t need any special preparation for this course, but it is useful to be familiar with IPFS and libp2p concepts (hosts, streams, pinning, chunking...).

A computer or laptop running go-ipfs will be necessary to install and play with IPFS Cluster as we will have some on-hands sections for participants to try out things.
