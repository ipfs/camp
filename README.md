At the same time, many features of IPFS and related technologies work best on an 'always-connected' network that simply doesn't exist in the mobile world. In this deep dive, we will explore the issues inherent to p2p systems operating in mobile environments, discuss some existing solutions, and hopefully outline a research/development agenda that will help catalyze a wave of new IPFS-based mobile solutions. | soon™ |
| [Private content on IPFS 📦](DEEP_DIVES/11-private-content-on-ipfs.md) | <a href="https://github.com/ianopolous"><img src="https://github.com/ianopolous.png?size=200" alt="ianopolous" width="100" /></a> | Can we have a private group chat implemented on IPFS? | soon™ |

FUSE support is [here](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/blob/v0.4.21-rc3/docs/fuse.md). What are current limitations, challenges? What needs to happen to enable mounting of MFS? [WebDAV](https://github.com/ipfs/in-web-browsers/issues/146) is often used in network storage drives, and mainstream operating systems come with native support for mounting WebDAV as drives. It could supersede Writable Gateway and create a surface for interop with apps that provide built-in client-side support for WebDAV. | soon™ |
| [IPNS link rot](DEEP_DIVES/34-ipns-link-rot.md) | <a href="https://github.com/alanshaw"><img src="https://github.com/alanshaw.png?size=200" alt="alanshaw" width="100" /></a> |  Right now, IPNS needs to be refreshed by original publisher every day, otherwise it stops working. There should be a way to pin IPNS address so that other peers keep refreshing the last valid entry when original node goes offline, keeping the last version alive even if the original publisher disappears forever. | soon™ |
| [Deterministic CIDs! Reproducible File Imports! Verifable HTTP Gateways!](DEEP_DIVES/35-deterministic-cids-reproducible-file-imports-verifiable-http-gateways.md) | <a href="https://github.com/lidel"><img src="https://github.com/lidel.png?size=200" alt="lidel" width="100" /></a> |  How to deterministically get the same CID for the same data, even if default parameters of `ipfs.add` change?

| [Using CRDTs to build real-time collaborative DApps](DEEP_DIVES/39-using-crdts-to-build-real-time-collaborative-dapps.md) | <a href="https://github.com/jimpick"><img src="https://github.com/jimpick.png?size=200" alt="jimpick" width="100" /></a> |  What are the hurdles to using CRDTs in dapps with IPFS? How can we make peer-base easier to understand and use? | soon™ |
| [Better NAT traversal so that Relay servers are a last (not first) resort](DEEP_DIVES/40-better-nat-traversal-so-that-relay-servers-are-a-last-not-first-resort.md) | <a href="https://github.com/raulk"><img src="https://github.com/raulk.png?size=200" alt="raulk" width="100" /></a> | The current cost of running relay servers for IPFS is unsustainable.  We need to implement better NAT hole punching mechanisms in libp2p to reduce the usage of relay servers by NAT’d hosts.  TCP hole punching has a success rate of ~60%, so we should be preferentially hole punching. TCP simultaneous open is one example. STUN servers are another example; yet another is making every non-NATed host in a libp2p network a relay node. | soon™ |
| [libp2p message orientation](DEEP_DIVES/42-libp2p-message-orientation.md) | <a href="https://github.com/bigs"><img src="https://github.com/bigs.png?size=200" alt="bigs" width="100" /></a> | libp2p is currently stream-oriented. We want to enable message-oriented communication (e.g. UDP). Help us envision what the APIs would look like, and how an application could simultaneously hold stream-based and message-based conversations with peers in the world via libp2p. | soon™ |
| [IPFS metrics and usage statistics 📦](DEEP_DIVES/43-ipfs-metrics-and-usage-statistics.md) | <a href="https://github.com/lanzafame"><img src="https://github.com/lanzafame.png?size=200" alt="lanzafame" width="100" /></a> | How to collect telemetry like application metrics and usage in a distributed world | soon™ |
| [Decentralized Data Processing](DEEP_DIVES/44-decentralized-data-processing.md) | <a href="https://github.com/alari"><img src="https://github.com/alari.png?size=200" alt="alari" width="100" /></a> | How could we process large amounts of data in permissionless networks? Use cases, verifiable state transitions, aggregations and bulk updates, etc. | soon™ |
| [Building Dynamic P2P Applications](DEEP_DIVES/45-building-dynamic-p2p-applications.md) | <a href="https://github.com/jkarni"><img src="https://github.com/jkarni.png?size=200" alt="jkarni" width="100" /></a> |  IPFS and its associated technologies are mostly static. Radicle is an attempt to build a dynamic P2P web on top of IPFS; one which can host applications with the same abilities of the centralized servers of today to receive inputs from various people or sources. | soon™ |
| [Better file chunking 📦](DEEP_DIVES/46-better-file-chunking.md) | <a href="https://github.com/mib-kd743naq"><img src="https://github.com/mib-kd743naq.png?size=200" alt="mib-kd743naq" width="100" /></a> | Within the IPFS stack/ecosystem, just as within computing as a whole, an uncompressed stream of untagged octets is a fundamental unit of exchange. As a general-purpose data storage system IPFS needs to handle an unbounded variety of content represented by such streams. Handling the maximum amount of this variety efficiently ( ideally by default ) would likely have an outsized impact on the future adoption of IPFS as a long-term data interchange medium/format. | soon™ |
| [Dynamic DAG traversal](DEEP_DIVES/47-dynamic-dag-traversal.md) | <a href="https://github.com/maparent"><img src="https://github.com/maparent.png?size=200" alt="maparent" width="100" /></a> | Extend IPLD to cross between immutable and mutable references | soon™ |
| [Design Patterns for DWeb Apps](DEEP_DIVES/48-design-patterns-for-dweb-apps.md) | <a href="https://github.com/leshokunin"><img src="https://github.com/leshokunin.png?size=200" alt="leshokunin" width="100" /></a> | Most IPFS apps have UX issues. We will pick a feature of an existing app, and improve its UX by simplifying how to interact with it, how it works. Textile.io lowered the permission and roles system from ~15 methods to 2 this way! | soon™ |
| [IPFS and Guix 📦](DEEP_DIVES/49-ipfs-and-guix.md) | <a href="https://github.com/ambrevar"><img src="https://github.com/ambrevar.png?size=200" alt="ambrevar" width="100" /></a> | Exploration into existing or potential issues with integrating IPFS with Guix | soon™ |
