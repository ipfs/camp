## What you will learn with this Course

In this workshop we'll take a dive into understanding how Qri interacts with IPFS to create a version control system.

You'll use Qri to build a version-controlled dataset you can actually use. You'll automate updates, integrate other’s data, and publish your work back to the DWeb. You’ll see how collaborative data is not just possible but _better_ on the DWeb.

To make sure you get a chance to work with data you're more closely aligned with, you'll have a choice of building one of three datasets:
* **An annotated Bibliography that fills in details & renders to PDF for you**
* **Automated, scheduled analysis of github contributor stats**
* **A dashboard of libp2p network peer data**
