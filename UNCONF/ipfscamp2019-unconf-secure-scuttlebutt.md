# Secure Scuttlebutt Unconf

Many people in the IPFS ecosystem are also on the SSB ecosystem and some people manifested the desire to learn more about SSB during informal hallway conversations during the event. SSB provides an easy to use decentralized platform that fosters meaningful human relationships and interaction.

The way the unconf was handled was very informally. People popped in and out. Some were new to SSB others were seasoned hermies coming to say hi and help the new users. What we did was show the available clients and help them install [patchwork](https://github.com/ssbc/patchwork) which is the easiest one. After the instalation, we onboarded people on the network and helped them find the content they wanted. 

The host was [Andre Alves Garzia](https://github.com/soapdog) and unfortunately he didn't kept a detailed list of who attended the unconf but he kept count of how many people were chatting and there were about 8 people floating in and out.

Andre also shown a prototype of IPFS integration in one of the clients: [Patchfox](https://patchfox.org) which he maintains.
