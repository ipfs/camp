Keep in mind that _space is limited_, but we will try to accommodate as many projects as we can.

Don't worry if your presentation lacks polish or not everything works 100% of the time: what we're looking for is **experimental**, innovative, unexpected ‚Äî and maybe a little bit of the impossible. Conversation starters, not pitch decks. And if something breaks, chances are your neighbors will be eager to help you fix it! ü§ì

To re-iterate: the fair is not intended for sales pitches, business development, or promoting a commercial product: it is not a trade show. We ‚ù§ the ever-expanding ecosystem of commercially successful projects based on IPFS and the DWeb in general, but for this event please bring an interesting hack or experimental feature, not something that you're trying to sell.

### Presenters

<img width="823" alt="the fair takes place here" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/204986/59112027-82fd5c80-8942-11e9-8d59-89ea1977319f.PNG">

If you've been selected as a presenter, congratulations! You get to set up in the circled area above (and maybe a bit outside it if we end up with overflow). You'll need to bring (at minimum) a PC/laptop/whatever your demo runs on. We will provide a power hookup, a monitor (on request), and potentially other small supplies: if you have an interesting presentation idea, let us know! This isn't meant to be a boring old poster session (not to be confused with the [not-at-all-boring Poster Projects](../../POSTER_PROJECTS/README.md)) so **be creative!** You can also bring swag, within reason (stickers, patches, etc)

A projector will be running a slideshow in the room throughout the event, so if you have one, please provide a logo, promo image, or short clip/animation (<10s) that we can include.

The fair runs for 2 hours (1630-1830) on the last day of the conference, which is the same time as the Unconf, so you may want to assign 2-3 people in shifts (if possible) so everyone gets a chance to walk around and see everything else.

### Everyone Else

If you're just visiting, relax, check out the projects, and don't be shy! Everyone standing by a table is dying to hear your questions, seriously.


### Overview

- **Objective**: Give a platform for experimental and exploratory work from PL members and the IPFS community to be showcased in a relaxed environment, with opportunities for hands-on interaction, delight, and playfulness.  No demo fail anxiety due to time pressure.
- **Activity**: Presenters operate a small "station" showcasing their project. Attendees can wander around at their leisure, interacting with demos and experiments.
- **Outcome**: Work that may have otherwise lingered in somebody's experiments folder/drawer sees the light of day. Cutting edge features revealed and tested in front of a non-judgemental crowd. Everyone leaves the Fair with an expanded notion of what is possible.

### How

1-2 dozen tables, each presenting a project. Fair runs for 2 hours on Saturday (1630-1830), opposite the [Unconference](https://github.com/ipfs/camp/tree/master/UNCONF)

### FAQ

Q: What if I'm the only rep of my project at the Camp? Can I walk away from my station/see the Unconf?

A: No problem! We ask you to be in attendance for at least a full hour of the fair. After that, your project can be in a more autonomous/self-explanatory mode (it may help to print a supplementary explanation for when you're away, too)

---

Q: My demo can be presented unattended before/after the Fair, is that possible?

A: Great! Please note this in your application and we'll do our best to make it run throughout the event

---

Q: My project involves lasers/heavy machinery/strobing lights/etc

A: AWESOME! Do note this in your application, though

---

Q: I need a budget of ‚Ç¨X to make this happen

A: Mention that in the EQUIPMENT section and we can talk :)
